## General
This folder contains my personal projects written in order to increase my coding skills.

## Projects
List of my finished projects:
* Backpropadation algorithm from scratch recognizing digits from MNIST dataset.
    * Original Version written ~ late 2019
        Achieved ~ 73 % accuracy with 25 mins learning epoch
    * Newer version written ~ early 2022 
        Achieved ~ 83 % accuracy with 1,5 s learning epoch.
        Improving on code quality, speed, efficiency.
* Baza Danych Studentow ~ early 2021
    First aproach at writing bigger project with comments and documentation.


After much struggle I managed to restore original version of my backpropagation project written in early 2019. Because of additional experience gathered in the meantime I decided to rewrite it in a better way. 

Rewritten version shall be added here besides the original after winter/Chrismas break.
