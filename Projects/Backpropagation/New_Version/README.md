This folder holds new version of my personal backpropagation project.

It can be used either by writing new *.cpp file which utilizes the Model class.

In order to run with minimal overhead just run file run.sh which 
- compiles main.cpp file,
- runs it,
- deletes executable file.

Function WriteWeights completely overwrites file with given name so use it carefully.

For me each training epoch with given example model took arour 9 - 10 s but your mileage may vary.
